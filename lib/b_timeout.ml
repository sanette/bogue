(* Execute actions after a specified timeout *)

(* Warning: the Timeout by itself will not generate any event. Therefore, if the
   action needs an immediate redraw by the main loop, the redraw event should be
   triggered, or the action_event (if just breaking the wait_event loop is
   enough). TODO ? Maybe it's better that all timeouts break the the wait_event
   loop? *)
