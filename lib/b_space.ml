(* New implementation of Space, based on the Layout resize mechanism. *)
(* Since we cannot know in advance where the space layout will reside, we invoke
   a Sync action to install the resize actions. Warning: Sync actions are
   executed in the same order as they are registered. Another possibility (as in
   the previous Space implementation) is to use an Avar (animated variable),
   which would force actions to be executed in the order of the layout hierarchy
   (top to bottom). However: 1. the Avar is computed *after* the resize functions
   are executed. 2. Avar actions are not triggered if the layout is not shown. *)

(* Warning: currently Space elements can not be applied to a scrollable layout
   obtained by [make_clip]. *)
