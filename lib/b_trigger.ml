(* TODO: it would be more efficient to store directly the room, rather that

   (not to mention that this can cause serious problems when the event lives
   longer than the room...) But this implies creating a new event type, not
   using the Sdl.Event directly. *)

(* Some remarks about the mouse_enter/leave events, in relation to
   animation. (To test this, use example 28 where there is a Select list
   combined with a scrolling.) In the functions push_mouse_enter/leave, we
   create a new event each time because it IS possible that several mouse_enter
   events get in the queue, eg. in the following scenario:

   - trigger mouse_enter
   - trigger another event (eg. mouse_motion)
   - new main loop iteration
   - the mouse_motion event is treated
   - the mouse leaves the widget and enters another one: we trigger a new mouse_enter
   (it is easy to do this in case of animation, because then there is a "long"
   FPS wait in the loop... change this?)

   - end of the loop. Now we have two mouse_enter events in the queue.

   What makes this possible is

   1. only one event is treated per iteration (2022: not true anymore)
   2. there might be quite a long delay in the loop in case of animation

   This behaviour has a drawback: during an animation, mouse_enter/leave events
   may lag behing real time.

   In fact, the design of 2 is questionable: one could design the main loop
   another way: the animation does not use a FPS delay, but instead would react
   to a repetitive event that would be triggered at 60FPS. Or move the code of
   Timer.fps inside the main loop without blocking.
