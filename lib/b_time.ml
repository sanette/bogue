SDL_GetTicks

This function is not recommended as of SDL 2.0.18; use SDL_GetTicks64() instead, where the value doesn't wrap every ~49 days. There are places in SDL where we provide a 32-bit timestamp that can not change without breaking binary compatibility, though, so this function isn't officially deprecated.
